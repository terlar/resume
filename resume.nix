      Programming and problem solving is one of my great passions in life, if I am presented with a problem I will eagerly put my full focus on the problem until a solution is reached.

      I have 15+ years of professional experience developing large scale microservice ecosystems with the past 8 years shifting focus towards the DevOps movement and enabling engineers to be more productive.

      Most recently I have used Nix, Golang, Python and TypeScript, however I don't see a problem with developing in any other language, the motto is: use the best tool available.
